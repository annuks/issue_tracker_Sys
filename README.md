# Issue_Tracker_System

## Project Description
#### Issue tracker web application can be used to create an issue in the listed projects on the Home page. A project can be added by providing project title, author and description. After adding the project it will be added in the list. By clicking on particular project from the list , A project detail page will be displayed. Here an issue can be created on that project by entering issue title and description. Also one can filter data via Author, Title, Description or Labels.
Tech Stacks: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node JS and MongoDB.
##### Filteration from dynamic data was bit difficult for me while doing this project. Also some validation and authorisation could be added in this project.

#### To run this project in local development server use vs code and install npm : npm start
This Project is also deployed on Heroku and can be accessed via :https://issue-tracker-sys.herokuapp.com/
